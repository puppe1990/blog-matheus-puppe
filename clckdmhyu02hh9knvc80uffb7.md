# prepend and include in Ruby

In Ruby, the `prepend` keyword is used to mix a module into a class or an object, in a way that the methods, constants, or variables of the module are inserted before the methods, constants, or variables of the class or object itself.

The `prepend` keyword is similar to the `include` keyword, which is used to mix a module into a class or object. However, while `include` mixes the module after the class or object, `prepend` mixes the module before the class or object, which means that the methods, constants, or variables of the module will have precedence over the methods, constants, or variables of the class or object.

For example, consider the following code, which defines a `Logger` module, and which mixes the module into the `User` class using the `include` and `prepend` keywords:

```ruby
module Logger
  def log(message)
    puts message
  end
end

class User
  include Logger
  prepend Logger

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def log(message)
    puts "User: #{message}"
  end

  def greet
    log "Hello, #{@name}!"
  end
end

user = User.new("John")
user.greet
# => User: Hello, John!
# => Hello, John!
```

In this example, the `Logger` module defines a `log` method, which outputs a message to the standard output. The `User` class includes and prepends the `Logger` module, which means that it mixes the `log` method of the module before and after the `log` method of the class. When the `greet` method is called, the `log` method of the `Logger` module is called first, and it overrides the `log` method of the `User` class, which is called second.

The `prepend` keyword is useful when you want to mix a module into a class or object, and you want to ensure that the methods, constants, or variables of the module take precedence over the methods, constants, or variables of the class or object. This can be useful to override or extend the behavior of the class or object, or to provide additional or specialized functionality. However, you should use `prepend` with caution, as it can cause conflicts or confusion if not used properly.
