# Creating React apps with ChatGPT

## **How I Made ChatGPT Prompts Using Chat**

As a developer, I'm always looking for ways to improve my skills and learn new things. One of the tools that I've been experimenting with lately is GPT-3, the powerful natural language processing system developed by OpenAI. I was curious to see how I could use it to build something useful, so I decided to create ChatGPT Prompts, a simple web app that generates writing prompts using GPT-3.

In this article, I'll walk you through the process of building ChatGPT Prompts, from setting up the project to integrating GPT-3 and deploying the app.

I will show some of prompts I use:

> 1\. Start prompt  
>   
> Create a react site for useful CHATGPT prompts is a site with a search for prompts and a separate for categories All, resume, Copywriting, Role Playing, Programming, Useful, Prompts, Daily Life, Marketing, Writing, Learning New Things, Language Learning. For each categories create a useful prompt example to use in chatgpt, create a button to copy this prompt and use beauty bootstrap layout with good colors.

and this is the initial response:

and I went and more prompts and descriptions for the app..

> #prompt to create a readme  
> create a readme to use in github  
>   
> \# prompt to generate topics to repository  
> create topics to ChatGPT Prompts project

  
and the final result is in my github:
