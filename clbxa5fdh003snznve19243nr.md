# Ethereum in Ruby

To use Ethereum in Ruby, you will first need to install the `ethereum.rb` gem. This gem provides a Ruby interface to the Ethereum blockchain and allows you to interact with the Ethereum network using Ruby.

Once you have installed the gem, you can start using it in your Ruby code by requiring it and creating an Ethereum client object. This client object can be used to connect to the Ethereum network and perform various operations, such as sending transactions, querying the blockchain, and interacting with smart contracts.

Here is an example of how you might use the `ethereum.rb` gem to send a transaction on the Ethereum network:

```ruby
require 'ethereum.rb'

# Create an Ethereum client
client = Ethereum::HttpClient.new('https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_API_KEY')

# Set the private key for your Ethereum wallet
private_key = 'YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY'

# Get the current nonce (number of transactions sent) for your wallet
nonce = client.eth_get_transaction_count(private_key, 'pending')

# Create the transaction object
tx = Ethereum::Transaction.new(
  nonce: nonce,
  gas_price: 20_000_000_000,
  gas_limit: 21_000,
  to: '0xYOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS',
  value: 1_000_000_000_000_000_000,
  data: '0x'
)

# Sign the transaction with your private key
signed_tx = tx.sign(private_key)

# Send the signed transaction to the Ethereum network
client.eth_send_raw_transaction(signed_tx)
```

This is just a simple example of how you can use the `ethereum.rb` gem to interact with the Ethereum network in Ruby. There are many more features and capabilities provided by the gem, so be sure to check out the documentation for more information.
