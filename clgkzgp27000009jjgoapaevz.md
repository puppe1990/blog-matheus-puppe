The field of artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant advancements in recent years, with the potential to revolutionize industries and improve many aspects of our lives. However, along with these opportunities come significant risks that policymakers must address to ensure that the development and deployment of AI systems are safe, ethical, and aligned with human values and priorities. In this article, we will explore the policy recommendations to combat risks from advanced AI systems during a proposed 6-month pause in their development.

Overview of the Policy Recommendations

The policy recommendations to combat risks from advanced AI systems during the proposed 6-month pause are as follows:

1. Mandate third-party auditing and certification of high-risk AI systems before deployment.
    
2. Regulate access to computational power used for training advanced AI systems. Require risk assessments and plans for risk mitigation, especially for high-risk systems. Monitor compute usage and supply chains to enforce this.
    
3. Establish national AI regulatory agencies to oversee AI progress, require impact assessments, enforce rules, share lessons learned, and promote transparency. Coordinate internationally.
    
4. Establish liability for harms caused by AI systems.
    
5. Prevent and track leaks of AI models, especially large language models.
    
6. Increase funding for technical research on aligning advanced AI systems with human values and priorities.
    
7. Develop standards for identifying and managing AI-generated content, especially "deep fakes."
    

Mandating Third-Party Auditing and Certification

The first policy recommendation is to mandate third-party auditing and certification of high-risk AI systems before deployment. High-risk AI systems include general-purpose systems, systems trained on a lot of data/compute, and systems that could impact people's wellbeing. The certification process should require risk mitigation and disclosure of any residual risks. Third-party auditing and certification would help ensure that AI systems are developed and deployed safely and ethically, with potential risks identified and mitigated before deployment.

Regulating Access to Computational Power

The second policy recommendation is to regulate access to computational power used for training advanced AI systems. This would require risk assessments and plans for risk mitigation, especially for high-risk systems. Monitoring compute usage and supply chains would also be necessary to enforce these regulations. This policy recommendation recognizes that access to powerful computational resources is necessary for developing advanced AI systems, but it also presents significant risks if not regulated.

Establishing National AI Regulatory Agencies

The third policy recommendation is to establish national AI regulatory agencies to oversee AI progress, require impact assessments, enforce rules, share lessons learned, and promote transparency. These regulatory agencies would coordinate internationally and help ensure that AI systems are developed and deployed safely and ethically. They would also help address the complexity of regulating AI systems, which often have unpredictable and unintended consequences.

Establishing Liability for Harms Caused by AI Systems

The fourth policy recommendation is to establish liability for harms caused by AI systems. As AI systems become more autonomous, interconnected, and unpredictable, it is hard to determine who is responsible for their behaviors and impacts. Laws and policies are needed to address this issue and ensure that those responsible for harms caused by AI systems are held accountable.

Preventing and Tracking Leaks of AI Models

The fifth policy recommendation is to prevent and track leaks of AI models, especially large language models. This policy recommendation recognizes that AI models can be misused and deployed in unintended ways if not properly secured. Preventing and tracking leaks would help ensure that AI models are only used for their intended purposes and not for malicious or harmful activities.

Increasing Funding for Technical Research

The sixth policy recommendation is to increase funding for technical research on aligning advanced AI systems with human values and priorities. This "AI safety" research is crucial to reduce risks from progress in the field. By increasing funding for this type of research, policymakers can ensure

Another important policy recommendation for policymakers is to establish liability for harms caused by AI systems. As AI systems become more autonomous and interconnected, it becomes increasingly difficult to determine who is responsible for their behaviors and impacts. There is a need for clear laws and policies that can address this challenge.

In addition to liability, policymakers must also prevent and track leaks of AI models, especially large language models. These models can be misused and deployed for harmful purposes, so it is essential to have systems in place to prevent unauthorized access and misuse. This can be achieved through appropriate regulations, monitoring, and enforcement mechanisms.

Furthermore, policymakers should increase funding for technical research on aligning advanced AI systems with human values and priorities. This research is crucial for reducing the risks associated with the rapid progress in AI. By investing in AI safety research, policymakers can ensure that AI is developed and used in a way that benefits society as a whole.

Finally, policymakers should develop standards for identifying and managing AI-generated content, especially "deepfakes." These standards can help reduce the spread of misinformation and manipulated media, which can have serious social and political implications. By establishing clear rules and policies for AI-generated content, policymakers can ensure that AI systems act in users' best interests.

In conclusion, policymakers must take action to govern the development and use of advanced AI systems. The policy recommendations outlined above can serve as a starting point for policymakers to establish oversight and governance mechanisms for AI. By working together and coordinating internationally, we can develop and use AI systems in a way that benefits humanity while minimizing the risks associated with these powerful technologies.
