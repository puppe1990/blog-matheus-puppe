# How to deploy a Ruby on Rails application on Heroku

Heroku is a popular cloud platform that allows you to easily deploy and host web applications, including Ruby on Rails applications. In this guide, we will explain how to deploy a Ruby on Rails application on Heroku.

Before you begin, you will need to create a Heroku account, and install the Heroku command-line interface (CLI) on your computer. You will also need to have a Ruby on Rails application that you want to deploy, and a Git repository for your application.

To deploy your Ruby on Rails application on Heroku, follow these steps:

1.  In your terminal, navigate to the root directory of your application, and run the `heroku login` command to log in to your Heroku account.
    
2.  Run the `heroku create` command to create a new Heroku app for your application. This will generate a unique app name and a Git remote for your app.
    
3.  Run the `git push heroku master` command to push your application code to the Heroku app. This will trigger the deployment process, and Heroku will automatically build and configure your app.
    
4.  Run the `heroku run rake db:migrate` command to run any database migrations that are required by your application. This will ensure that your app's database is up-to-date and ready for use.
    
5.  Run the `heroku open` command to open your app in your default web browser. Your app should now be live and accessible to the public.
    
6.  Run the `heroku logs --tail` command to view the logs for your app. This will allow you to monitor the activity and performance of your app, and to troubleshoot any issues that may arise.
    

Overall, deploying a Ruby on Rails application on Heroku is a simple and straightforward process. By following the steps outlined in this guide, you can quickly and easily deploy your app, and make it available to the public.
