# 5 common Ruby on Rails mistakes and how to avoid them

Ruby on Rails is a powerful and popular web development framework, but it can be easy to make mistakes, especially for beginners. In this guide, we will introduce 5 common Ruby on Rails mistakes, and explain how to avoid them.

1.  Not following the Rails conventions: Ruby on Rails is built on a set of conventions that dictate how files, folders, and classes should be named and organized. By not following these conventions, you can make your code more difficult to read and maintain, and you can introduce errors and inconsistencies. To avoid this mistake, it is important to familiarize yourself with the Rails conventions, and to follow them consistently in your code.
    
2.  Using Rails as a black box: Rails is an opinionated framework that provides many built-in solutions and shortcuts, but it is not a magic wand that can solve all of your problems. By using Rails as a black box, and not understanding how it works and what it does, you can make poor decisions, and you can miss out on the benefits and flexibility that Rails offers. To avoid this mistake, it is important to learn the inner workings of Rails, and to use it as a tool, rather than as a crutch.
    
3.  Writing long and complex controllers: Controllers are the glue that binds your models and views together, but they should not be a dumping ground for all of your application's logic. By writing long and complex controllers, you can make your code more difficult to read and maintain, and you can introduce coupling and dependencies that make your code fragile and brittle. To avoid this mistake, it is important to follow the principle of thin controllers, and to keep your controllers small and focused, and to delegate complex logic to your models and services.
    
4.  Not using tests: Testing is an essential part of the development process, and it is especially important in Rails, where the framework and the ecosystem provide many tools and libraries for testing. By not using tests, you can introduce bugs and regressions, and you can make your code more difficult to change and evolve. To avoid this mistake, it is important to learn and use the different types of tests, such as unit tests, integration tests, and acceptance tests, and to write tests for your application.
    
5.  Not using gems and libraries: Ruby on Rails has a rich ecosystem of gems and libraries that can help you to extend the functionality of your applications, and to save time and effort. By not using gems and libraries, you can reinvent the wheel, and you can miss out on the benefits and best practices that they offer. To avoid this mistake, it is important to learn about the different gems and libraries that are available, and to use them wisely and judiciously in your projects.
    

Overall, by avoiding these common mistakes, you can improve the quality and reliability of your Ruby on Rails applications, and make them more effective and successful.
