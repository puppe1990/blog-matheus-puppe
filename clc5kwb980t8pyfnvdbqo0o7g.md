# How organize models in rails

In a Ruby on Rails project, the `app/models` folder is where you will store the model files for your application. A model is a class that represents a data entity, such as a user, an order, or a product, and defines the attributes, relationships, and behavior of that entity.

To organize your models in a Rails project, you can follow these best practices:

*   Name your model files after the entity that they represent, in singular form, and with a `.rb` file extension. For example, if you have a model for users, you could name the model file `user.rb`.
    
*   Place your model files in the `app/models` folder, and use subfolders to organize related models. For example, if you have a model for orders, you could create a `orders` subfolder in the `app/models` folder, and place the `order.rb` model file in that subfolder.
    
*   Use descriptive and meaningful names for your models, to clearly identify the entity that they represent, and to avoid naming conflicts and confusion. For example, instead of using a generic name, such as `entity.rb`, you could use a more specific and descriptive name, such as `product.rb` or `customer.rb`.
    
*   Use inheritance and modules to organize related models and to share common functionality. For example, if you have a model for users, and a model for admins, you could create a `User` superclass, and use inheritance to create a `Admin` subclass that inherits from `User`. You could also create a `Permissions` module, and include it in both the `User` and `Admin` models, to share common permissions-related functionality.
    

Overall, by following these best practices, you can organize your models in a logical and effective way, and make your code easier to read and maintain.
