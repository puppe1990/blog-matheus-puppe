# Why Open source is better that Open Core

Open source software is better than open core software in many ways. Open source software is software that is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute. It is based on the principles of collaboration, transparency, and community, and it is typically developed and maintained by a community of volunteers.

In contrast, open core software is a commercial model that is based on open source software. Open core software typically consists of a core set of open source components that are freely available, and a set of proprietary components that are only available to paying customers. The open core model allows the company that develops the software to generate revenue from the proprietary components, while still benefiting from the collaboration and community of the open source project.

There are several reasons why open source software is better than open core software. First, open source software is more transparent and collaborative. Because the source code is freely available, anyone can see how the software works, and contribute to its development. This promotes collaboration and innovation, and makes it easier to fix bugs and add new features.

Second, open source software is often more reliable and flexible than open core software. Because open source software is developed and maintained by a community, it is typically well-tested and well-documented. This makes it easier to use and customize, and it allows users to tailor the software to their specific needs.

Third, open source software is typically more cost-effective than open core software. Because open source software is freely available, users can download and use it without paying any fees or licensing costs. This can save organizations and individuals a significant amount of money, especially if they are using the software for large or complex projects.

In conclusion, open source software is generally better than open core software because it is more transparent, collaborative, reliable, flexible, and cost-effective. Open source software allows anyone to use, modify, and distribute the software without paying any fees or licensing costs, and it promotes collaboration and innovation within the software development community.
