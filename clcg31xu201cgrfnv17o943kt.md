# What is the objective of object-oriented programming (OOP)

The objective of object-oriented programming (OOP) is to provide a model for designing and implementing software, based on the concept of objects, which are instances of classes, and which represent entities or concepts in your application.

Object-oriented programming has several objectives, which are related to the characteristics and benefits of OOP, and which are aimed at improving the quality, efficiency, and maintainability of software. Some of these objectives are:

*   Encapsulation: The objective of encapsulation is to hide the internal state and behavior of objects from the outside, and to provide a public interface, which can be used to access and manipulate the objects. Encapsulation allows objects to be self-contained and independent, and it allows them to be easily reused and tested.
    
*   Abstraction: The objective of abstraction is to provide a simplified and abstract representation of entities or concepts in your application, and to hide the details and complexity of their implementation. Abstraction allows objects to be flexible and adaptable, and it allows them to be easily understood and used by other objects or developers.
    
*   Polymorphism: The objective of polymorphism is to allow objects to have multiple forms or implementations, and to be used and treated in a consistent and interchangeable way. Polymorphism allows objects to be adapted or extended to new requirements or situations, and it allows them to be easily integrated and composed with other objects.
    
*   Inheritance: The objective of inheritance is to allow objects to be derived from other objects, and to inherit their attributes and behavior. Inheritance allows objects to share common functionality or characteristics, and it allows them to be specialized or customized to specific needs or purposes.
    

Overall, the objective of object-oriented programming is to provide a model and a set of principles, which can be used to design, implement, and maintain software, in a modular, scalable, and maintainable way.
