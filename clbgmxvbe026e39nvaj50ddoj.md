# Solid Concepts

In computer programming, the SOLID principles are a set of five principles that provide guidance on how to design software that is easy to maintain, extend, and understand. These principles were first introduced by Robert C. Martin (also known as Uncle Bob), and they are considered to be an important part of the software development process.

The SOLID principles are as follows:

1.  Single Responsibility Principle: A class should have only one reason to change. This means that a class should have a single, well-defined responsibility, and all its methods and properties should be related to that responsibility.
    
2.  Open-Closed Principle: Software entities (such as classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification. This means that you should be able to extend the behavior of an entity without modifying its existing code.
    
3.  Liskov Substitution Principle: Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types. This means that if a class is derived from a base class, the derived class should be able to be used in place of the base class without any issues.
    
4.  Interface Segregation Principle: Clients should not be forced to depend on methods they do not use. This means that you should avoid designing large, monolithic interfaces that provide a lot of functionality that the client may not need. Instead, you should design smaller, more specific interfaces that are tailored to the needs of the client.
    
5.  Dependency Inversion Principle: High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. This means that you should avoid coupling your code to specific implementations of components or services. Instead, you should use abstractions (such as interfaces or abstract classes) that define the contracts that the components or services must fulfill.
