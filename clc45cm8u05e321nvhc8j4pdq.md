# Folders in Rails

There is no one "best" way to organize folders in a Ruby on Rails project, as the structure and organization of a project will depend on its size, complexity, and requirements. However, there are some general principles and conventions that you can follow to organize your project in a logical and effective way.

In a typical Ruby on Rails project, the top-level folders will include:

*   `app`: This folder contains the core files and code of your application, including controllers, models, views, and helpers.
    
*   `bin`: This folder contains executables and scripts that are used by the Rails framework, such as the Rails server and rake tasks.
    
*   `config`: This folder contains configuration files for your application, such as routes, environments, and initializers.
    
*   `db`: This folder contains files related to the database, such as schema, migrations, and seeds.
    
*   `lib`: This folder contains custom libraries and modules that you create for your application.
    
*   `log`: This folder contains logs generated by your application, such as server logs and database logs.
    
*   `public`: This folder contains static assets, such as images, stylesheets, and JavaScript files, that are accessible to the public.
    
*   `test`: This folder contains test files, such as unit tests and integration tests, that are used to test the functionality of your application.
    
*   `vendor`: This folder contains third-party code and libraries that are not managed by the Rails framework, such as gem files and external libraries.
    

Overall, by organizing your project into these core folders, you can keep your code organized and maintainable, and make it easier to navigate and work with your project.
