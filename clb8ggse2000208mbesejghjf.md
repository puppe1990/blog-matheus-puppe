# Ruby Lambda

In the Ruby programming language, a lambda is a type of anonymous function. It is a way to create a function without giving it a name. Lambdas are often used when working with higher-order functions, which are functions that operate on other functions.

Lambdas are similar to regular functions in Ruby, but they have some key differences. For example, a lambda takes only one argument, whereas a regular function can take multiple arguments. Lambdas also use a different syntax for defining and calling them. To define a lambda, you use the `lambda` keyword, followed by a block of code enclosed in `{ }`. To call a lambda, you use the `.call` method and pass in any arguments the lambda takes.

Here is an example of defining and calling a lambda in Ruby:

`# Define a lambda`

`double = lambda { |x| x * 2 }`

`# Call the lambda and pass in an argument`

`result = double.call(5)`

`# Print the result`

`puts result # 10`

Lambdas are useful in Ruby because they allow you to create functions that can be passed as arguments to other functions. This makes your code more flexible and modular and allows you to write functions that can be customized or reused in different contexts. Lambdas are especially useful in functional programming, where they are often used to create small, specialized functions that can be combined in powerful ways.
